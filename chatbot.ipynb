Lots of ways to learn but there\\\\\\'s a lot of noise too. If you\\\\\\'re in the US look into the NSF I-corps programs that are free and will introduce you to basics of lean startup, and their customer discovery programs where you can test your idea for market problem/solution fit. If you\\\\\\'re not in the US, Y combinator startup school is good, and \"the lean startup\" book is excellent. Applying lean principles will get you further faster to a go/no go decision.     \\\\n2) If you find your idea has validated interest, after completing step 1, I suggest writing a basic product requirements document. Use ChatPRD to help you format it such that an agency can review it and opine on the degree of difficulty, tech stack, cost orbit, etc.   \\\\nGood luck!\\', \"Even though your idea is feasible your country won\\'t allow you to do so due to regulations and tax burden..\", \\'As a founder, you should have a'), Document(id='22343065-801d-4c2c-8f74-6c1d6dbdbac4', metadata={}, page_content=\"How to get funding as a startup?

These platforms offer support, resources, and networking opportunities that can be valuable, even if your time is limited. You might find that engaging with like-minded individuals can provide both motivation and practical advice.\\\\n\\\\nAs you prepare for your launch, focus on building a compelling story around your app’s value and vision.

The golden rule? “Done is better than perfect.” Don’t get lost in the endless cycle of development. Waiting until the very last minute to launch can cost you time, energy, and money. Instead, aim to create a minimum viable product (MVP) that scores at least 60 out of 100.
